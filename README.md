## About
The Password Manager is a simple Python command-line application that allows users to create accounts with usernames and securely store hashed passwords. Users can also log in using their credentials and verify their identity.

## Features
1. Account creation: Users can create an account by providing a username and a password. The password is securely hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm before storage.
2. Login: Users can log in by providing their username and password, and the system will verify their identity by comparing the stored hashed password with the provided password.
